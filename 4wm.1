.SH MODES
There are four modes: tiling, floating, monocle, and video.

Tiles the window in one of the four directions: left, right, top, bottom. The current 
window is split in half and the new window is added in the selected direction.

desktops' gap and/or the monitors' panel. The additional clients are hidden behind the 
current shown window.
.TP

A fullscreen mode, where the clients take up the entire workspace, and additional clients
are hidden behind the current shown window.
